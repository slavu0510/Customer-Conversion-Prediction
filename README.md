Customer Conversion Prediction for a New- age Insurance Company

**Problem Statement**
You are working for a new-age insurance company that employs multiple outreach plans to sell term insurance to customers. Telephonic marketing campaigns remain one of the most effective ways to reach out to people, but they also incur a lot of cost. Therefore, it is important to identify customers who are most likely to convert beforehand so that they can be specifically targeted via calls. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a client will subscribe to the insurance.
